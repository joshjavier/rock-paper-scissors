# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

A simple implementation of RPS in JavaScript.

This is part of the [Foundations](https://theodinproject.com/courses/foundations) course in [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

To add a twist, *maybe* I'll add a toggle to change the language to Filipino, changing "Rock Paper Scissors" to "Jack en Poy", etc.

## How to Play

Currently, the game can only be played from the browser console.

1. Bring up the console by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>I</kbd> and selecting the *Console* tab.
2. Start a new game by running `game()`. You can set the number of rounds when you include an integer as parameter, e.g. `game(3)` (default is 5).
